## Features

- Interactive recipe selection and execution
- Recipe status tracking (success/failure/not executed)
- Custom command configuration
- Variable transformations
- Command execution logging
- Beautiful terminal UI with color-coded status indicators

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer
- Drupal installation with recipes

## Installation

1. Install using Composer:

```bash
composer require --dev d34dman/drupal-recipe-manager
```

2. Create a configuration file in your Drupal project root:

The script requires a `drupal-recipe-manager.yaml` in the directory
it is invoked.

An example file for a ddev based project is as follows.

```yaml
# drupal-recipe-manager.yaml
# Directories to scan for recipes
scanDirs:
  - recipes
  # You can also include "core" recipes ir desired.
  # - web/core/recipes
# Custom commands for recipe management
commands:
  ddevRecipe:
    description: "ðŸš€ Run Drush recipe command using ddev"
    command: "ddev drush recipe ../${folder}"
    requiresFolder: true
  # phpRecipe:
  #   description: "ðŸš€ Run Drupal recipe command"
  #   command: "php ../../web/core/scripts/drupal recipe ../${folder} -v"
  #   requiresFolder: true
logsDir: recipes/logs
```

## Usage

```

## Configuration

### Directories

- `scanDirs`: List of directories to scan for recipes
- `logsDir`: Directory for storing logs (relative to scripts directory)

  ddevDrush:
    description: "Run Drush recipe command"
    command: "ddev drush recipe ../${folder}"
  localDrush:
    description: "Run Drush recipe command"
    command: "ddev drush recipe ${folder}"  
  php:
    description: "Run Drush recipe command"
    command: "php core/scripts/drupal recipe ${folder}"  
```

```
